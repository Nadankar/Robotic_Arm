1. Hardware Setup
Assemble the Robotic Arm: Put together the robotic arm components, including servomotors, sensors, and structural parts.

ESP32 Connection: Securely connect the ESP32 microcontroller to the robotic armâ€™s control elements.

Power Supply: Ensure a stable power supply is connected to the ESP32 and the servomotors to avoid interruptions.

2. Software Development
ESP32 Programming: Write and upload the firmware to the ESP32 using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO, which handles motor control and wireless communication.

Smartphone App Development: Develop a smartphone application to send control commands to the ESP32. The app can use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for communication.
3. Integration
System Integration: Integrate the hardware and software components. Ensure the ESP32 can receive commands from the smartphone and control the robotic arm accordingly.

Network Setup: Configure the Wi-Fi network settings for the ESP32 to ensure it can communicate with the smartphone.

4. Testing
Unit Testing: Test individual components, like each servomotor, to ensure they function correctly.

Integration Testing: Conduct tests to ensure that all components work seamlessly together.

User Acceptance Testing: Have users test the system to ensure it meets their needs and functions as expected.

5. Installation
Physical Setup: Install the robotic arm in the desired location, ensuring it is securely mounted.

Connectivity Check: Verify that the ESP32 is connected to the power supply and can communicate with the smartphone app.
